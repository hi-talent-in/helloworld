Variables are containers for storing data values.

Creating Variables:
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)


Variable Names
Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"


Output Variables::

The Python print statement is often used to output variables
To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)


Global Variables:
Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()
