Built-in Data Types:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

for find data type just type ()
x = 5
print(type(x))


Numbers:
Numeric data types are needed when you want to perform arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication on variables
a=10
print(a+2) #print l2

1 Integers:
Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or 0.
An integer is many times called an int

a=-10    # negative integer print -10
print(a)
res=a*a  #positive integer prints 10
print(res)


2 Float:
A float is a number with a decimal point.  
pi=3.14
print(pi)  #print 3.14


3 Complex Numbers:
Complex numbers are specified as <real part> + <imaginary part> j.
Complex numbers are used for electrical signal processing, almost all of electrical appliances rely heavily on complex number calculations.
c=2+3j
print(c) #prints 2+3j

Strings:
A string is a sequence of one or more characters (letters, numbers, symbols)
Strings exist within either single quotes ' or double quotes " or even triple quotes  ‘ ‘ ‘
Strings are not understood by python, it is a message to the user in the user’s local language like Hindi, Marathi, Gujrathi.

c=2+3j
print(c)  #prints 2+3j
msg='Hello World'
print(msg)  #hello world

fname="Anamika"
lname="Upadhyay"
full=fname+lname
print("My Name is ",full) #My Name is AnamikaUpadhyay

Lists:
A list refers to a collection of elements
The elements of a list do not all have to be of the same data type.
A list is an ordered sequence of data.

1 Creating a list:
mylist1=[2,-3,0,4,-1]
mylist2=[10,"Java","Python",68.7]

An alternative way to create a list from another sequence is using the list function.
mylist3=list("python")
#['p','y','t','h','o','n']

 Accessing elements of a list
a.ACCESSING POSITIVE INDEX
----------------------------------
python |      R     |    SQL     |
------ |------------| -----------|
  0    |     1      |     2      |
----------------------------------
Lists are indexed by positive integers, starting with zero.
Use the indexing operator  [ ] (square brackets) to access or update individual items of the list:

a.ACCESSING NEGATIVE INDEX:

----------------------------------
python |      R     |    SQL     |
------ |------------| -----------|
 -3    |    -2      |    -1      |
----------------------------------
Lists are indexed by negative integers, starting with zero.
Use the indexing operator  [ ] (square brackets) to access or update individual items of the list:

USING A RANGE:
Use the indexing operator  [start: stop : step] we can get the sublist of the list.
If the start is not specified it defaults to 0, if the stop is unspecified it defaults to the length of the list and if step defaults to 1.
The reverse of the list is thus simply possible using [::-1]

ADDING ELEMENTS TO A LIST:
To append new items to the end of a list, use the append() method:
ds.append(‘Tableau’)
To insert an item in the middle of a list, use the insert() method:    
ds.insert( 0, ‘SAS’ )
To extend a list with elements from other list use extend():   
ds.extend([‘Big Data’ , ‘Deep Learning’])
Use the plus (+) operator to concatenate lists

SORTING THE LIST:
Sorting a list with sorted() returns a new list
sort() is a method / operation on a list which sorts the list inplace.

REVERSING THE LIST:
We can reverse the list with reverse() method in-place.
We can also use the range [::-1] which returns a new reversed list.

COPYING THE LIST:
A shallow copying a list can be created with the copy() method.


LIST COMPREHENSION:
h_letters=[letter for letter in 'human']
print(h_letters)

TUPLE:
A tuple is a frozen list i.e tuple cannot be modified once it is created.
A tuple is declared with round parentheses ()
As tuple are immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than with list
						
1 Tuple Packing and Unpacking:
A tuple can be created without any parenthesis, similarly it can also be extracted

2 Tuple Nesting:
A tuple can contain another tuple or a list.

3 Creating an empty tuple:
T=() or
T=tuple()

Creating a tuple with one element:
char1=("a")
print(char1) #o/p a tuple with one element in it ('a',)


SETS:
A set is a list with unique elements.
A set is itself mutable however it can contain only immutable elements 9i.e elements which cannot be changed later (for hash purpose).
The location of the element in a set is unordered which means they are placed randomly at any position and hence cannot be indexed with [n] syntax.

 Creating a Set:
To create a set use the curly brackets and place the elements separated by comma.
Note: To create an empty use, leaving the empty parentheses will create a dictionary, instead use the set function.


 Adding an Element:
To add an element in a set use the add or update method.

 Removing element from a set:
Since a set is unordered it doesn’t support indexing, hence we cannot remove any element from its position like a set.
The remove(elem) or discard(elem) method is used to remove a particular value. They differ only when the element is not found: in the case of remove it throws ValueError while discard doesn’t give any error.
The pop() method in set doesn’t accept any index in a set and arbitrarily removes any element from the set. 


Frozenset:
These are like sets except that they cannot be changed, i.e. they are immutable.
A Frozenset() takes an iterable object as input and returns them as immutable. These sets are inbuilt functions of python which freezes the iterable objects and makes them immutable.


#tuple of vowels
vowels=('a','e','i','o','u')
fset=frozenset(vowels)
print('frozen set',fset)
print('empty frozen set ',frozenset())

#froZensets are immutable
fset.add('v')


DICTIONARY:
Python dictionary is a collection of key value pairs.
The keys  of the dictionary are unique while the value may be duplicated.
If the key is known then its value can be easily retrieved.
Dictionary works like a list where the indexes are user defined

 Creating a dictionary:
To create a dictionary use the curly brackets and place the key separated from the value with a colon.
d1={'a':'apple','b':'ball','c':'cat'}
d2={1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'}


 Accessing the elements of the dictionary:
To access the elements of the dictionary use the index or retrieve the element using the get() method

Adding and Updating the elements of the dictionary:
To add or update the elements of the dictionary use the index.


Removing the elements of the dictionary
To remove the elements of the dictionary use the index.

Retrieving Keys and Values
We can retrieve a collection of keys / values from the dictionary using the key() and the values() method.
